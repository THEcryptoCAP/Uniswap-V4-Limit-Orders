//The goal for us is that we create a generic Hook that can be attached to any pool on Uniswap v4. This hook must allow users to place (and cancel) take-profit orders on-chain.
// Then, at some point in time, if it is possible for that take-profit order to be fulfilled because the price has moved enough to make that happen.
// we should fill that order and the user should then be able to claim the swapped tokens out into their own wallet.

    // 2. Our Hook, which is also an ERC-1155 contract, will mint ERC-1155 tokens to the user's wallet representing their order. 
    //    These tokens act kind of as a receipt - so if their order does get fulfilled in the future, they can return these receipt tokens back to the hook to withdraw their swapped tokens out.
    // 3. We hook into the afterSwap function - and every time any trader makes a swap, we check the new price of the tokens and execute
    //    any take-profit orders in the afterSwap function through the pool by market-selling those tokens given the new price
    // 4. Users who created those orders can then come back and exchange their ERC-1155 tokens for the swapped tokens.
